# 7dtd-craftulator
Web app to generate a Bill of Materials for a craftable thing in 7 Days To .

Given you want to make a specific thing,

And given what resources you already have,

* How much of each raw material/salvaged material will you need to gather?
* [TODO] What station will you have to craft it at?
* What intermediate products will you need to craft and at what station?
* [TODO] What perk unlocks this recipe?


This is a Kotlin/JS single-page web app.

This app needs access to a copy of the crafting recipes in the game, 
which it is not licensed to provide. 

Please upload your `recipes.xml` file from your 7dtd installation. 
This is usually found in C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\7 Days To Die\Data\Config\
